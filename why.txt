I am currently taking this coding class because of individuals highlighting the importance of coding. Also because of an want to gain knowledge for a chance of future use in my job. Also an owner of a
robotics company told me it would be good to learn. Also a family friend from San Francisco said that the course looked to be well set up with its knowledge base.
