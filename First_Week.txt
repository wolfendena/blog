Good week outside of monday. Learned all about how computers function an 
 how to use code to form actions and commands. I created my first functioning
arcade game, and have installed and worked with Ubuntu. Managed to use code to
create aliases to increase my speed of commands as well as the creation,  
movement, and use of files.
